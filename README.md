# 21 Probabilities

This is an educational companion app for teaching dynamic probability when playing blackjack or 21.
The teacher acts as the dealer and is playing one versus one against a learner who will interact with the app.

The game is modified for simplicities' sake and should be played like this:
1. Dealer deals themself two cards and the learner two cards, both face up. 
2. The learner wants to beat the dealer while avoiding a bust. The learner references this app and clicks on the cards dealt to observe the probability information listed. 
They may decide to hit (get dealt a card and click that respective card)
or allow the dealer to move (click "next round").
3. After the learner is finished and clicked "next round," the dealer continues to draw until they either bust or beat the learner. The dealer will proceed to click on any cards he draw then "next round" which will repeat from step 1, but the cards used are put aside. 

It is encouraged to ask the learner about how do they think the probabilities are calculated to promote probability understanding.
"What are the total amount of cards left?"
"Why is the probability of drawing a 10 24% right now?"
"How does this app get a probability of you drawing a bust to be 68% from this point of the game?"
